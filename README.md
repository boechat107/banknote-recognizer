# banknote-recognizer

An image processing project to recognize the currency value of banknotes in natural
scenes.

The main motivation is to learn all necessary techniques and apply different image
processing libraries, like [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [BoofCV](http://boofcv.org/)
and [eye-boof](https://github.com/boechat107/eye-boof).
The inspiration came from one of the
[final projects](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Project_13/index.html)
(by the authors Christian Elder and Michael Digman) of the Stanford's course
EE368/CS232 on digital image processing.

## Usage

There is nothing usable yet, but probably it'll have some Android app to take shoots.

## License

Do whatever you want with this, but remember to look at the libraries' licenses first.
