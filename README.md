# banknote-recognizer

An image processing project to recognize the currency value of banknotes in natural scenes.

The main motivation is to learn all necessary techniques and apply different image
processing libraries, like (OpenCV)[http://opencv.org/], (BoofCV)[http://boofcv.org/]
and (eye-boof)[https://github.com/boechat107/eye-boof].

## Usage

There is nothing usable yet, but probably it'll have some Android app to take shoots.

## License

Do whatever you want with this, but remember to look at the libraries' licenses first.
